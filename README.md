## If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer
## Analysis Strategy:
Group by Order_Priority and Shipping_Method to evaluate the alignment of shipping method and urgency:
SELECT Order_Priority, Shipping_Method, COUNT(*) AS Num_Orders, 
       SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost
FROM orders
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Shipping_Method
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Shipping_Method;
## Interpretation Advice
Interpretation Advice:
If Express Air is mostly used for Critical or High priority, and Delivery Truck is used for Low priority, then the shipping cost is well aligned.
If Express Air is used frequently for Low priority, it suggests inefficiency.
If Delivery Truck is used for High or Critical, it may cause customer dissatisfaction due to slow delivery.
